**Tray** is an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) plugin that can be used to launch the app
on system startup and run it in the background, adding an icon to the system tray that it
can be minimised to and a global hotkey to toggle visibility of the app's windows.

| Launch on startup          | Open Obsidian automatically whenever you log into your computer.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Enabled                                                                                         |
| Run in background          | Hide the app and continue to run it in the background instead of quitting it when pressing the window close button or toggle focus hotkey. If both this and "Launch on startup" are enabled, windows will be hidden automatically whenever the app is initialised. | Disabled (Otherwise the window would disappear as soon as the plugin is installed and enabled.) |
| Create tray icon           | Add an icon to your system tray/menubar to bring hidden Obsidian windows back into focus on click or force a full quit/relaunch of the app through the right-click menu. _Changing this option requires a restart to take effect._                                 | Enabled                                                                                         |
